# Introduction

This folder contains an example ReactNative project with `plotprojects-react-native-module` integrated. 

# Quickstart

After creating an account in PlotProjects [dashboard](https://admin.plotprojects.com/dashboard), you need to update the tokens in both Android and iOS projects. Tokens are located in:

* `ios/Supporting Files/plotconfig.json`
* `android/app/src/main/assets/plotconfig.json`

Once tokens are updated, you can run using the following commands:

* `npx react-native run-android` for running on Android device.
* `npx react-native run-ios` for running on iOS device.

For more details, please refer to [PlotProjects official documentation](http://files.plotprojects.com/documentation/android/3.13.0/how-to-guides/React-Native-integration-guide/).
